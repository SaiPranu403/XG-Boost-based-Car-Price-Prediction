-XG BOOST

XGBoost, or eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a leading machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency
and effectiveness in structured data tasks. It sequentially builds an ensemble of decision trees, correcting
errors made by previous trees. With built-in regularization, tree pruning, and handling of missing values,
XGBoost prevents overfitting and enhances model performance.
